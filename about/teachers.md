<p>
  Hello! My name is Lynn Hockenberger and it is a true joy for me to come to work every day at Children of Hope Preschool! I have been privileged to serve as Director of this wonderful school since 2009 and have been a teacher here since the school opened in 2007. I have enjoyed being an early childhood educator since moving to the Valley in 2000.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Children’s Literature with a focus in Elementary Education. I continue to take courses in the field of Early Childhood Education and have completed the Aim 4 Excellence National Director’s Credential sponsored by Arizona’s First Things First initiative. I serve as the Faith Representative on the First Things First East Maricopa Regional Council, I am the Secretary of the Evangelical Lutheran Education Association (ELEA) Board, and am a Member-at-Large on the (AzAEYC) Arizona Association for the Education of Young Children Board, the local chapter of the NAEYC. I am also an active member of the Christian Directors of the East Valley group.
</p>
<p>
  My husband, Fritz, is a pilot with American Airlines and we are the proud parents of two adult children. Our daughter Laura graduated from The University of Arizona and The University of Charleston in West Virginia and is now a Physician Assistant at a local ENT practice. Our son Jake, also a graduate of The University of Arizona, is studying to be a teacher at Grand Canyon University while working as a teacher's aide at a Title 1 elementary school in Tucson.
</p>
<p>
  I am so proud to be a part of this wonderful preschool and to work with such a great staff. I so believe in this special ministry and am very thankful to have the opportunity to work with God’s precious children each day.

<p>
  My name is Amy Angilletta and it is an absolute joy for me to work at Children of Hope! I have been an assistant teacher here at Hope since 2014 and have had the privilege of working with all our littles, from the Toddlers through the Pre-K classes.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to coming to Children of Hope, I worked at the elementary school level, for several years, as a substitute teacher, special education assistant, and a K-3 Instructional Assistant at Estrella.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in New Jersey, where I graduated from The College of New Jersey with a bachelor’s degree in Biology and a minor in Psychology.  My husband, Mike and I have two great adult kids.  Our daughter Taylor graduated from ASU in May 2020 and is currently working as a licensed Music Therapist here in the East Valley.  Our son Kyle is starting his junior year at ASU this fall majoring in Jazz Performance (drum set) with a business minor. We moved to Ahwatukee in the summer of 2010 for my husband’s job as a professor at ASU. Go Sun Devils! In my spare time I enjoy traveling, hiking, spending time with my girlfriends, attending live music events and watching my kids performances.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to another wonderful year getting to know and nurture our little Ducklings!

<p>
  My name is Katrin Guete and working at Children of Hope is a dream come true. I love our school, the staff, and foremost the students in this wonderful community. Toddlers are truly amazing—full of curiosity, joy and spectacular ideas.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in Germany near the beautiful Lake of Constance. I always enjoyed teaching—my parents and brother are teachers too (it might run in the family ;-)). Previously I was an assistant teacher at Ahwatukee Preschool in the toddler room, and I offered weekly German lessons to 2nd through 5th grade bilingual children of the German community here in the valley. Back in Germany I was an English teacher for elementary students at a community college. While in school myself I was assistant coach at our local gymnastics club. I’m also a certified yoga instructor – dating back to my time living in Asia. My other passion is photography—I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts at Lazi Academy, Stuttgart (Germany).
</p>

<p>
  Our journey has taken our family around the world. We moved in 2009 from Munich to Seoul, onwards in 2012 to Hong Kong, to arrive in Phoenix in 2014. Today my husband Andreas and I, our kids Tom, Lias, and Elli, and our dog Luna are happy residents of Ahwatukee.
</p>

<p>
  Our daughter Elli just graduated from the COH in May 2024. Sending her here was the best decision ever. I love hiking, painting, baking sourdough bread, and drinking coffee preferably with friends. I can’t wait to see these young minds bloom in and outside of our classroom!

  It has been my pleasure to work at Children of Hope in the PreK classroom since 2010.
  I also enjoy teaching a Science Enrichment class in the spring.
</p>

<p>
  I have been a member of Esperanza Lutheran Church for over 20 years and have enjoyed working
  with our Sunday School and Vacation Bible School programs through the years. I am originally from
  New Mexico; I grew up on the Navajo Reservation where my parents were missionaries for the
  Christian Reformed Church.
</p>

<p>
  I received a BS from the University of New Mexico and have lived in the Phoenix area with my husband Paul for many years. I worked at the American Cancer Society until my first daughter was born. I have three grown children, Heidi, Julie and Stephen (married to Kat). I love teaching little children and watching them grow and learn.

  Hello! I am thrilled about being a part of the Children of Hope Preschool.  I will be an assistant teacher in the Duckling class.  I have been an assistant in the toddler classroom since 2022. I look forward to watching your amazing children grow.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved to Arizona when I was 12. I left Arizona to attend California Lutheran University and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology and Religion. I continued my education at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and received a Masters degree in Theology.  I spent 30 years in youth and family ministry in the Evangelical Lutheran Church.  In 2015 I joined the staff of Creative Arts School for Youth teaching 3-year-olds through Pre-K.  In 2020 I joined the staff of Esperanza Lutheran as the Children's Ministry Director.
</p>

<p>
  My Husband Peter and I have three wonderful children.  Joel is a pediatric resident in Austin Texas, Caleb a college student studying education at Scottsdale Community College, and Johanna a 2nd grade teacher at Redfield Elementary in Scottsdale, Arizona.
</p>

<p>
  We are sports people! We cheer for the St. Louis Cardinals baseball, University of Michigan football and love to watch golf.  I enjoy hiking and exploring the beautiful state of Arizona. One of my favorite things is to play pickleball with my family.
</p>

<p>
  I am very excited to be part of an amazing Duckling team with Mrs. Dolny and Mrs. Angilletta, it is going to be a great year!

  Hello! I am very excited to be the Lead Teacher in the Frog Pre-K classroom! I originally helped in the Ducklings class when I first came to COH. I was a 3’s lead teacher for the previous 12 years and a middle school teacher before that.
</p>
<p>
  I was born and raised in the great state of Oregon before coming to Arizona to play basketball at NAU. I earned my degree in Elementary Education with an emphasis in Health, PE and Coaching. Once I retired from playing basketball I began teaching and coaching.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently a basketball coach at Desert Vista. I spend my mornings with my littles and head over to high school in the afternoon with my big girls. I love both age groups!
</p>
<p>
  My husband, Tyler, is also from Oregon though we didn’t know each other when we both lived there. We met at NAU. We have two children, Grace is my volleyball player and currently attends The University of New England in Maine. My son, Ryan, is my baseball and golf guy. He graduated from DV in May 2024 and will be attending the University of Oregon. In my very sparse minutes of free time, I love to take pictures and make cards.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to a wonderful year with our Froggies, watching them learn and grow!

  Hello Parents! My name is Rebecca Paterson and I have been an Assistant Teacher at Children of Hope since 2019. I truly adore working with preschool aged kiddos as each day is full of colorful imagination, growing independence and amazing discovery.
</p>
<p>
  My husband, Todd, and I moved to Ahwatukee from St. Louis in 2001 and we have been in love with the beautiful state of Arizona ever since. We have two children, Brody and Sophie. Brody is a Freshman at ASU and Sophie is in 7th grade at Altadena Middle School. Sophie is a proud alumni of Children of Hope. She started in the Toddler Class (Mrs. Pierce was a teacher in her class☺) and continued until graduating from Pre-K. Children of Hope has always held a very special place in our family’s heart, and we have so many fond memories of when Sophie attended.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a B.S. from Southern Illinois University in Management Information Systems and was a software developer for Anheuser-Busch Corporation. Upon moving to Arizona, I pivoted into Social Work and became a Group Home Manager which allowed me the opportunity to work with individuals of all ages with different abilities and collaborate with several State agencies such as Arizona Social Services and Foster Care Services. Once I had children I became a stay at home mom and avid school volunteer until I started at Children of Hope as an assistant teacher.
</p>
<p>
  I am thankful for the opportunity to be a part of all the exciting experiences your child will enjoy this year and I look forward to helping create wonderful memories for your child and family!
</p>

  I am excited to work as an Assistant Teacher with our young learners. I truly adore this age as it is full of colorful imagination, amazing discovery and growing independence.

  I am originally from Iowa, although I did spend some of my elementary years in Ahwatukee. I
  earned my BA in Exercise Science/Athletic Training from Central College in Pella, IA, in 2004
  and my MS in Athletic Training from UNI in Cedar Falls, IA, in 2006. I moved to Phoenix in 2006
  and worked as an athletic trainer at Mountain Pointe High School in Ahwatukee for 10 years.
</p>
<p>
  During that time, I also earned my teaching certificate and taught Sports Medicine and a few PE
  classes for 4 of those years. In October of 2007, I found a new preschool that was looking for
  teachers and I started working at Children of Hope in the 2s class. I stayed for 7 years with
  Mrs. K in the 2s and 3s classes until my oldest son was born in 2014 and I took on more hours
  at the high school. Then I returned as a parent in 2016! The past 2 years I have served on the
  preschool board. I truly love this school and want to see all the best for this little place!
</p>
<p>
  I was married to my husband, Nathan, in 2012. We have 2 boys, Chase and Charlie. Chase is 10 years old and a 5th grader at Monte Vista. He attended Children of Hope for 3 years. He made some best friends for life in his time there. Charlie is 8 and is in 3rd grade at Monte Vista. He also attended COH for 3 years. Both boys play baseball and I enjoy coaching their teams.
</p>
<p>
  Outside of the classroom, I also am a consultant for Usborne Books & More because I love their
  books so much! I also have coached both boys in Little League for the past 3 years with many of
  the Children of Hope friends. As a family, we love to get out of the heat and enjoy some time in
  the mountains exploring and trying to burn off the never-ending boy energy we have!! We also like
  to take a summer trip to Iowa for the boys to have extended time with grandparents and cousins!

  Hello! My name is Vanessa Smith and I am truly delighted to be joining the Children of Hope family! This school and these magical ladies are one of a kind! I can’t wait to get to know you and your kiddos!
</p>

<p>
  Both my daughter, Charlee, and my son, Milo attended COH and had a wonderful experience. In fact, it was with the loving guidance of the teachers here at COH that our son Milo was eventually diagnosed with Autism and is now thriving with the supports he receives.
</p>

<p>
  I have learned so much about the Neurodivergent brain on this journey with Milo, and have taken trainings on sensory strategies, ABA therapy, Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), Social Emotional Reciprocity, Hyper or Hypo Reactivity to Sensory Input, and recognizing Challenging Behaviors. I work closely with his Board Certified Behavior Analyst to continue to educate myself on how to meet his needs. Advocating is a large part of my everyday and I’m incredibly thankful for the resources available and to be a resource to others. I so respect the importance of these early years as a child’s brain is developing and I will nurture your child’s growth and development, laying the critical foundation that sets them up for success.
</p>

<p>
  I am a native to Arizona (a unicorn) I know! I grew up in North Phoenix and have lived all over the valley, finally landing in Ahwatukee where my family and I have fallen in love with the community In my free time I enjoy spending time with my husband, Josh and our kids, going to the gym, iced coffee, going to concerts and meeting new people. I look forward to an incredible year with this wonderful community!
