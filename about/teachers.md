<p>
  Hello! My name is Lynn Hockenberger and it is a true joy for me to come to work every day at Children of Hope Preschool! I have been privileged to serve as Director of this wonderful school since 2009 and have been a teacher here since the school opened in 2007. I have enjoyed being an early childhood educator since moving to the valley in 2000.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Children’s Literature with a minor in Elementary Education. I continue to take courses in the field of Early Childhood Education and have completed the Aim 4 Excellence National Director’s Credential sponsored by Arizona’s First Things First initiative. I am looking into obtaining my Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Administration. I currently hold the Faith Representative seat on the First Things First East Maricopa Regional Council and am a member of both the Evangelical Lutheran Education Association (ELEA) and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).
</p>

<p>
  My husband, Fritz, is a pilot with American Airlines and we are the proud parents of two children, Laura, a senior at the University of Arizona, and Jake, a freshman at Pima Community College. Both of our children are proud members of the Pride of Arizona Marching Band at the UofA. Bear down!
</p>

<p>
  I am so proud to be a part of this wonderful preschool and to work with such a great staff. I so believe in this special ministry and am very thankful to work with God’s precious children.

  The adventure continues…and this school year it begins with precious two year olds! Talkative,
  tender, tenacious, tiny, timid, trusting, and thoughtful make this teacher very thankful for
  the opportunity to work with your children.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in Goose Bay, Canada and 6 weeks later moved to Texas.  I grew up mainly in the south
  and for three years lived in Okinawa, Japan where my dad was stationed. I graduated from Stephen
  F. Austin in Nacogdoches, TX with a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies (Early Childhood).
  I’ve enjoyed teaching Kindergarten, 2nd grade, 4th grade, and pre-school (4’s).
</p>

<p>
  Bill and I celebrated our 20th anniversary in January.  His job has moved us to Phoenix, Fort Worth,
  Ahwatukee, Singapore, and back to Ahwatukee.  As you can see Arizona keeps pulling us back.  We have
  3 amazing children. Emily will be a sophomore attending Purdue University and Robert and Billy (twins)
  will be starting their junior year at Desert Vista.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy volunteering for the band boosters, cheering on the Dallas Cowboys, baking, book club, and
  most of all watching my kids doing what they enjoy.  The fall is full of marching band shows (the boys)
  and the spring has many rowing regattas (Emily).
</p>

<p>
  I’m very excited and blessed to be a part of the Children of Hope staff and look forward to watching
  your children flourish in our class.

<p>
  My family moved to Ahwatukee in January 2000. My husband Kevin and I have two wonderful
  children. Tori is a junior nursing major at NAU and our son Trevor will be a senior at
  Desert Vista. I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, reading and watching football
  (Go Broncos!). I am looking forward to my time with your children and helping them to
  experience an exciting year.

  My name is Amy Angilletta and it is a joy for me to work at Children of Hope! This will be my third year at Hope and I am looking forward to seeing some familiar faces, as well as meeting all our new friends.  Again this year I will have the privilege of working with our 2 year olds as well as our Pre-K kiddos.
</p>

<p>
  Prior to coming to Children of Hope, I worked at the elementary school level, for several years, as a substitute teacher, special education assistant, and most recently as a K-3 Instructional Assistant at Estrella. 
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in New Jersey, where I graduated from The College of New Jersey with a bachelor’s degree in Biology and a minor in Psychology.  I have been married to my husband, Mike, for 23 years and have two children, Taylor, age 18 and Kyle, age 13.  Taylor will be heading to ASU this fall to study music therapy. Kyle will be in 8 th grade at Akimel, keeping busy with his percussion playing with both Akimel and Desert Vista bands. I keep busy as a proud booster of both the Desert Vista Thunder Marching Band and the Akimel A-al Rattler Band.  As a family, we enjoy traveling, hiking, movies and music. We moved to Ahwatukee in the summer of 2010 for my husband’s job as a professor at ASU. Go Sun Devils! I am looking forward to a wonderful year getting to know and nurture your children!

<p>
  My name is Lisa Krach and the easiest way to pronounce my last name is by saying the first
  syllable in “crocodile”. I have lived in Arizona for the past sixteen years with my husband
  and twenty year old daughter.
</p>

<p>
  I taught kindergarten and first grade for eight years and then became a reading specialist
  my final year in California. I earned my Master’s Degree in early childhood reading in 1996.
  I left teaching and moved to Texas when my daughter was born. I taught preschool for two years
  in Texas then we moved here to Arizona. I taught the last nine years here at Children of Hope
  and I am looking forward to another exciting year.

<p>
  It has been my pleasure to work in the Krach-o-dile class at Children of Hope for seven
  years, I have also been a member of Esperanza Lutheran Church for over 20 years.
</p>

<p>
  I am originally from New Mexico. I grew up on the Navajo reservation where my parents were
  missionaries. I received a BBA from UNM and moved to the Phoenix area with my husband Paul
  in 1988. I worked at the American Cancer Society until my daughter Heidi was born, at which
  time I became a stay-at-home-mom. I have three children: Heidi, a graduate of U of A, Julie,
  a graduate at ASU, and Stephen, a junior at ASU.
</p>

<p>
  I have always loved being a mom—and now I love being a teacher too!

<p>
  Hello!  My name is Marianne Luken!  I am originally from Piscataway, NJ, known for being the home of Rutger’s College.  I escaped the big city to attend college in Notre Dame, Indiana, at Saint Mary’s College where I earned a BA in Elementary Education with a minor in Math and a Computer Science Endorsement.  After college, I moved to North Carolina where I taught in the public schools of Nash County for four years.  I moved to Phoenix in 2003 and when my youngest turned three I taught at God’s Garden Preschool for 6 years in three year old and Pre-K classrooms.
</p>

<p>
  I have four children:  Emma Elisabeth (Junior at Seton Catholic), Jack David (8th grade at Altadena), Clare Marie (6th grade at Altadena), and Joseph Michael (4th grade at Sierra).  We are a very busy family (to say the least).  All four kids swim competitively which helps me tour the pools of the valley.  As for me, I am an avid crafter, I love to play sports, I read daily, and I love going on adventures with my kids.  I am thrilled to join the staff and happily anticipating the new school year.  I can guarantee we will have fun, laugh, learn, and be together in the best environment I can create!

<p>
  My name is Lori Palomaa and I am a rarity: a native Arizonan, born and raised in Phoenix. While this is my 5th year at Children of Hope working with Mrs. Hammer, I have been an active member of Esperanza Lutheran Church for 25 years. I have been married to my high school sweetheart, Ray, for 37 years, and we were blessed with two wonderful children: Our son, Eric (who works at The Brookings Institution) and his wife, Colleen, live and work in Washington, D.C. Our daughter Kimberly, a high school Math teacher at Monarch High School in the Boulder Valley School District, lives in Denver with her new husband, Quentin. The sparks did fly on the 3 rd of July as we celebrated their beautiful wedding in Boulder this summer.
</p>

<p>
  My greatest joy is working with children, and I have taught You & Me Baby (pre-natal/post partum & infant exercise classes), taught Sunday School (preschool-elementary), was the Sunday School coordinator for several years, taught Vacation Bible School, volunteered in my children’s classrooms and activities, coordinated (3 yrs) and taught (6 yrs) the Masterpiece Art program at Kyrene Monte Vista, worked extensively in the Kyrene School District as an Instructional Assistant at Monte Vista, a Resource Instructional Assistant at Colina, and as a Substitute Teacher at various schools within the Kyrene District. I worked for Mathnasium of Chandler at several Title I schools across the Valley, tutoring math as part of the No Child Left Behind Supplemental Education Services program. For several years, I have taught a Masterpiece Art Enrichment program for our Children of Hope Preschoolers, as well as at our Children of Hope Summer Camps. This past year I taught a Handwriting & Math Without Tears class & Enrichment on Fridays, and I am excited about this year’s program.
</p>

<p>
  As you can see, I love working with children! They are a gift from God, and there is nothing better than helping a child reach their potential and to share in their joy and excitement. I look forward to a fabulous year watching your child blossom and grow. Thank you for sharing all of them with us.
