<p>Hello and Welcome!</p>

<p>
  My name is Jessica Mueller, and I’m so glad you’ve found our happy little place here at Children of Hope. I have been in the field of education since 2001, with a focus on Early Childhood Education since 2008. It is truly an honor to step into the role of Director and follow in the incredible footsteps of Lynn Hockenberger.
</p>

<p>
  Originally from Oregon, I still miss the rain and cozy weather of the Pacific Northwest. I earned my degree in Elementary Education from Northern Arizona University and began my teaching career at Gethsemane Lutheran School, where I taught middle school for several years. I later joined Family of Christ, spending many rewarding years in the 3’s classroom. My journey at Children of Hope has included time in both the 2’s and Pre-K classrooms—shout-out to all my Lil Froggies!
</p>

<p>
  My husband, Tyler, is an electrical engineer, and we have two amazing children. Our daughter, Grace, recently graduated from the University of New England and is now coaching at Desert Vista. Our son, Ryan, lives in Oregon and is beginning his studies in Horticulture Science at Oregon State University.
</p>

<p>
  When I’m not on campus, you’ll likely find me at Desert Vista, where I coach volleyball and basketball.
</p>

<p>
  I am humbled and honored to be leading Children of Hope. It is truly a gift to do what you love each and every day. Please stop by and say hello &mdash; I’d love to meet or catch up with you!

  It has been my pleasure to work at Children of Hope in the pre-k class for 15 years. I’ve had fun being the assistant teacher and teaching a Science Enrichment class in the spring sometimes too. I’m a member of the church here and have enjoyed working with our Sunday School and VBS programs through the years. It has always been fun to teach as an assistant but I am so excited to be the lead this year and use all the knowledge that has been building from so many years in the classroom.
 </p>
 <p>
  I am originally from New Mexico. I received a BBS from UNM and have lived in the valley with my husband Paul since our marriage. I worked at the American Cancer Society until my daughter Heidi was born, at which time I became a stay-at-home-mom. I have had the privilege of raising three fantastic children, Heidi, Julie and Stephen and now I have a daughter-in-law, Kathryn. I have always loved being a mom and I love being a teacher too. I look forward to another exciting year here at COH, I am really excited to be a lead teacher!

  I’m Jess Pierce, and I am originally from Iowa, although I did spend some of my elementary years in Ahwatukee. I earned my BA in Exercise Science/Athletic Training from Central College in Pella, IA, in 2004 and my MS in Athletic Training from UNI in Cedar Falls, IA, in 2006. I moved to Phoenix in 2006 and worked as an athletic trainer at Mountain Pointe High School in Ahwatukee for 10 years and taught Sports Med/PE for 4 of those. In October of 2007, I found a new preschool that was looking for teachers and I started working at Children of Hope in the 2s class. I stayed for 7 years with Mrs. K in the 2s and 3s classes until my oldest son was born in 2014, and I took on more hours at the high school. Then I returned as a parent in 2016! This is my sixth year back as a lead teacher. I truly love this school and want to see all the best for this little place!
</p>
<p>
  I was married to my husband, Nathan, in 2012. We have 2 boys, Chase and Charlie. They both attended Children of Hope for 3 years. Chase is 11 and is in 6th grade at Altadena Middle School this year. He made some best friends for life in his time here. Charlie is 9 and in 4th grade at Monte Vista this year with some of his Children of Hope friends! Outside of the classroom, I have coached both boys in Little League over the past 7 years with many of the Children of Hope friends. As a family, we love to get out of the heat and enjoy some time in the mountains exploring and trying to burn off the never-ending boy energy we have!! We also like to take a summer trip to Iowa for the boys to have extended time with grandparents and cousins!

  My name is Katrin Guete and working at Children of Hope is a dream come true. I love our school, the staff, and foremost the students in this wonderful community. Toddlers are truly amazing—full of curiosity, joy and spectacular ideas.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in Germany near the beautiful Lake of Constance. I always enjoyed teaching—my parents and brother are teachers too (it might run in the family ;-)). Previously I was an assistant teacher at Ahwatukee Preschool in the toddler room, and I offered weekly German lessons to 2nd through 5th grade bilingual children of the German community here in the valley. Back in Germany I was an English teacher for elementary students at a community college. While in school myself I was assistant coach at our local gymnastics club. I’m also a certified yoga instructor – dating back to my time living in Asia. My other passion is photography—I graduated with a Bachelor of Arts at Lazi Academy, Stuttgart (Germany).
</p>
<p>
  Our journey has taken our family around the world. We moved in 2009 from Munich to Seoul, onwards in 2012 to Hong Kong, to arrive in Phoenix in 2014. Today my husband Andreas and I, our kids Tom, Lias, and Elli, and our dog Luna are happy residents of Ahwatukee.
</p>
<p>
  Our daughter Elli graduated from the COH in May 2024. Sending her here was the best decision ever. I love hiking, painting, baking sourdough bread, and drinking coffee preferably with friends. I can’t wait to see these young minds bloom in and outside of our classroom!

  I was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved to Arizona when I was 12. I left Arizona to attend California Lutheran University and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology and Religion. I continued my education at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and received a Masters degree in Theology. I spent 30 years in youth and family ministry in the Evangelical Lutheran Church. In 2015 I joined the staff of Creative Arts School for Youth teaching 3-year-olds through Pre-K. In 2020 I joined the staff of Esperanza Lutheran as the Children's Ministry Director.
</p>

<p>
  My husband, Peter, and I have three wonderful children. Joel is a pediatric resident in Austin Texas, Caleb a college student studying education at Scottsdale Community College, and Johanna is a 2nd grade teacher at Redfield Elementary in Scottsdale, Arizona.
</p>

<p>
  We are sports people! We cheer for the St. Louis Cardinals baseball, University of Michigan football and love to watch golf. I enjoy hiking and exploring the beautiful state of Arizona. One of my favorite things is to play pickleball with my family.
</p>

<p>
  I am very excited to be part of an amazing toddler team! It’s going to be a great year!

  Hello Parents! My name is Rebecca Paterson and I have been an Assistant Teacher at Children of Hope since 2019. I truly adore working with preschool aged kiddos as each day is full of colorful imagination, growing independence and amazing discovery.
</p>
<p>
  My husband, Todd, and I moved to Ahwatukee from St. Louis in 2001 and we have been in love with the beautiful state of Arizona ever since. We have two children, Brody and Sophie. Brody is a Freshman at ASU and Sophie is in 7th grade at Altadena Middle School. Sophie is a proud alumni of Children of Hope. She started in the Toddler Class (Mrs. Pierce was a teacher in her class☺) and continued until graduating from Pre-K. Children of Hope has always held a very special place in our family’s heart, and we have so many fond memories of when Sophie attended.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a B.S. from Southern Illinois University in Management Information Systems and was a software developer for Anheuser-Busch Corporation. Upon moving to Arizona, I pivoted into Social Work and became a Group Home Manager which allowed me the opportunity to work with individuals of all ages with different abilities and collaborate with several State agencies such as Arizona Social Services and Foster Care Services. Once I had children I became a stay at home mom and avid school volunteer until I started at Children of Hope as an assistant teacher.
</p>
<p>
  I am thankful for the opportunity to be a part of all the exciting experiences your child will enjoy this year and I look forward to helping create wonderful memories for your child and family!

  I am excited to work as an Assistant Teacher with our young learners. I truly adore this age as it is full of colorful imagination, amazing discovery and growing independence.

  Hello! My name is Vanessa Smith and I am truly delighted to be joining the Children of Hope family! This school and these magical ladies are one of a kind! I can’t wait to get to know you and your kiddos!
</p>

<p>
  Both my daughter, Charlee, and my son, Milo attended COH and had a wonderful experience. In fact, it was with the loving guidance of the teachers here at COH that our son Milo was eventually diagnosed with Autism and is now thriving with the supports he receives.
</p>

<p>
  I have learned so much about the Neurodivergent brain on this journey with Milo, and have taken trainings on sensory strategies, ABA therapy, Pivotal Response Treatment (PRT), Social Emotional Reciprocity, Hyper or Hypo Reactivity to Sensory Input, and recognizing Challenging Behaviors. I work closely with his Board Certified Behavior Analyst to continue to educate myself on how to meet his needs. Advocating is a large part of my everyday and I’m incredibly thankful for the resources available and to be a resource to others. I so respect the importance of these early years as a child’s brain is developing and I will nurture your child’s growth and development, laying the critical foundation that sets them up for success.
</p>

<p>
  I am a native to Arizona (a unicorn) I know! I grew up in North Phoenix and have lived all over the valley, finally landing in Ahwatukee where my family and I have fallen in love with the community In my free time I enjoy spending time with my husband, Josh and our kids, going to the gym, iced coffee, going to concerts and meeting new people. I look forward to an incredible year with this wonderful community!
