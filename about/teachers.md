<p>
  Hello! My name is Lynn Hockenberger and it is a true joy for me to come to work every day at Children of Hope Preschool! I have been privileged to serve as Director of this wonderful school since 2009 and have been a teacher here since the school opened in 2007. I have enjoyed being an early childhood educator since moving to the Valley in 2000.
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Children’s Literature with a focus in Elementary Education. I continue to take courses in the field of Early Childhood Education and have completed the Aim 4 Excellence National Director’s Credential sponsored by Arizona’s First Things First initiative. I am looking into obtaining my Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Administration. I currently hold the Faith Representative seat on the First Things First East Maricopa Regional Council and am a member of the Evangelical Lutheran Education Association (ELEA), the Christian Directors of the East Valley, and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).
</p>
<p>
  My husband, Fritz, is a pilot with American Airlines and we are the proud parents of two adult children. Our daughter Laura graduated from The University of Arizona and The University of Charleston in West Virginia and is now a Physician Assistant at a local family practice. Our son Jake is studying to be a school counselor at The University of Arizona – Bear Down! He is employed by the Tucson Unified School District and volunteers at a Tucson Boys & Girls’ Club.
</p>
<p>
  I am so proud to be a part of this wonderful preschool and to work with such a great staff. I so believe in this special ministry and am very thankful to have the opportunity to work with God’s precious children each day.

  My name is Amy Angilletta and it is an absolute joy for me to work at Children of Hope! I have
  been an assistant teacher here at Hope since 2014 and have had the privilege to work with all our
  littles, from the 2’s through the Pre-K classes. Currently, I get to spend my days with Mrs.
  Luken and our Pre-K Llamas.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to coming to Children of Hope, I worked at the elementary school level, for several years,
  as a substitute teacher, special education assistant, and most recently as a K-3 Instructional
  Assistant at Estrella. 
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in New Jersey, where I graduated from The College of New Jersey with a bachelor’s degree
  in Biology and a minor in Psychology.  My husband, Mike and I have two great, almost adult, kids.
  Our daughter Taylor will graduate from ASU in May 2020 with a degree in Music Therapy. Our son Kyle
  is a Junior at Desert Vista with a passion for all things drumming. We moved to Ahwatukee in the
  summer of 2010 for my husband’s job as a professor at ASU. Go Sun Devils! I enjoy volunteering for
  the band boosters, traveling, movies, attending live music events and watching my kids performances.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to another wonderful year getting to know and nurture your children!

  The adventure continues…and this school year it begins with precious two year olds! Talkative,
  tender, tenacious, tiny, timid, trusting, and thoughtful make this teacher very thankful for
  the opportunity to work with your children.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in Goose Bay, Canada and 6 weeks later moved to Texas.  I grew up mainly in the south
  and for three years lived in Okinawa, Japan where my dad was stationed. I graduated from Stephen
  F. Austin in Nacogdoches, TX with a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies (Early Childhood).
  I’ve enjoyed teaching Kindergarten, 2nd grade, 4th grade, and pre-school (4’s).
</p>

<p>
  Bill and I celebrated our 20th anniversary in January.  His job has moved us to Phoenix, Fort Worth,
  Ahwatukee, Singapore, and back to Ahwatukee.  As you can see Arizona keeps pulling us back.  We have
  3 amazing children. Emily will be a sophomore attending Purdue University and Robert and Billy (twins)
  will be starting their junior year at Desert Vista.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy volunteering for the band boosters, cheering on the Dallas Cowboys, baking, book club, and
  most of all watching my kids doing what they enjoy.  The fall is full of marching band shows (the boys)
  and the spring has many rowing regattas (Emily).
</p>

<p>
  I’m very excited and blessed to be a part of the Children of Hope staff and look forward to watching
  your children flourish in our class.

  It has been my pleasure to work at Children of Hope in Mrs. Krach’s class for ten years.
  I also enjoy teaching a Science Enrichment class in the spring.
</p>

<p>
  I have been a member of Esperanza Lutheran Church for over 20 years and have enjoyed working
  with our Sunday School and Vacation Bible School programs through the years. I am originally from
  New Mexico; I grew up on the Navajo Reservation where my parents were missionaries for the
  Christian Reformed Church.
</p>

<p>
  I received a BS from the University of New Mexico and have lived in the Phoenix area with my
  husband Paul for many years. I worked at the American Cancer Society until my first daughter was
  born.  I have three grown children, Heidi (married to Miguel), Julie and Stephen. I love teaching
  little children and watching them grow and learn.

  Hello! I am thrilled about being a part of the Children of Hope Preschool.  I am an assistant
  teacher in the Duckling class.  Children bring such joy and adventure. I look forward to
  watching your amazing children grow.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in Chicago, Illinois and moved to Arizona when I was 12. I left Arizona to attend
  California Lutheran University and received a Bachelor of Science degree in Sociology and Religion.
  I continued my education at the Lutheran School of Theology at Chicago and received a Masters degree
  in Theology.  I spent 30 years in youth and family ministry in the Evangelical Lutheran Church.
  In 2015 I joined the staff of Creative Arts School for Youth teaching 3-year-olds through Pre-K.
  In 2020 I joined the staff of Esperanza Lutheran as the Children's Ministry Director.
</p>

<p>
  My Husband Peter and I have three wonderful children.  Joel is a pediatric resident in Austin Texas,
  Caleb a college student studying education at Scottsdale Community College, and Johanna a 2nd grade
  teacher at Redfield Elementary in Scottsdale, Arizona.
</p>

<p>
  We are sports people! We cheer for the St. Louis Cardinals baseball, University of Michigan football
  and love to watch golf.  I enjoy hiking and exploring the beautiful state of Arizona. One of my
  favorite things is to play pickleball with my family.
</p>

<p>
  I am very excited to be part of an amazing Duckling team with Mrs. Dolny and Mrs. Angilletta,
  it is going to be a great year!

  Hello! I am very excited to be part of the Ducklings class, 2’s will be a new and fun adventure
  for me. I was a 3’s lead teacher for the previous 12 years and a middle school teacher before that.
</p>
<p>
  I was born and raised in the great state of Oregon before coming to Arizona to play basketball at NAU.
  I earned my degree in Elementary Education with an emphasis in Health, PE and Coaching.
  Once I retired from playing basketball I began teaching and coaching.
</p>
<p>
  I am currently a basketball coach at Desert Vista. I spend my mornings with my littles and head over
  to high school in the afternoon with my big girls. I love both age groups!
</p>
<p>
  My husband, Tyler, is also from Oregon though we didn’t know each other when we both lived there.
  We met at NAU. We have two children, Grace is my volleyball player and a senior at DV and Ryan is my
  baseball guy and a sophomore at DV. In my very sparse minutes of free time I love to take pictures
  and make cards.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to getting to know the little ducklings and families this year. It will be fun watching
  them learn and it should be a great place to grow!

  Hello Parents! My name is Rebecca Paterson and I am excited to return for my third year at Children of Hope as an Assistant Teacher. I truly adore working with preschool aged kiddos as each day is full of colorful imagination, growing independence and amazing discovery.
</p>
<p>
  My husband, Todd, and I moved to Ahwatukee from St. Louis in 2001 and we have been in love with the beautiful state of Arizona ever since. We have two children, Brody and Sophie. Brody is a Junior at Desert Vista and Sophie is entering the 5th grade at Monte Vista. Sophie is a proud alumni of Children of Hope. She started in the Toddler Class (Mrs. Pierce was a teacher in her class☺) and continued until graduating from Pre-K. Children of Hope has always held a very special place in our family’s heart, and we have so many fond memories of when Sophie attended.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a B.S. from Southern Illinois University in Management Information Systems and was a software developer for Anheuser-Busch Corporation. Upon moving to Arizona, I pivoted into Social Work and became a Group Home Manager which allowed me the opportunity to work with individuals of all ages with different abilities and collaborate with several State agencies such as Arizona Social Services and Foster Care Services. Once I had children I became a stay at home mom and avid school volunteer until I started at Children of Hope as an assistant teacher.
</p>
<p>
  I am thankful for the opportunity to be a part of all the exciting experiences your child will enjoy this year and I look forward to helping create wonderful memories for your child and family!
</p>

  I am excited to join Children of Hope as an Assistant Teacher in the Toddler Class.

  I am originally from Iowa, although I did spend some of my elementary years in Ahwatukee. I
  earned my BA in Exercise Science/Athletic Training from Central College in Pella, IA, in 2004
  and my MS in Athletic Training from UNI in Cedar Falls, IA, in 2006. I moved to Phoenix in 2006
  and worked as an athletic trainer at Mountain Pointe High School in Ahwatukee for 10 years.
</p>
<p>
  During that time, I also earned my teaching certificate and taught Sports Medicine and a few PE
  classes for 4 of those years. In October of 2007, I found a new preschool that was looking for
  teachers and I started working at Children of Hope in the 2s class. I stayed for 7 years with
  Mrs. K in the 2s and 3s classes until my oldest son was born in 2014 and I took on more hours
  at the high school. Then I returned as a parent in 2016! The past 2 years I have served on the
  preschool board. I truly love this school and want to see all the best for this little place!
</p>
<p>
  I was married to my husband, Nathan, in 2012. We have 2 boys, Chase and Charlie. Chase is almost
  6 and will be in 1st grade at Monte Vista next year. He attended Children of Hope for 3 years.
  He made some best friends for life in his time there. Charlie will be 4 in August and will be in
  the Pre-K extended day class next year. It will be a sad day to have no more kids of my own at
  Children of Hope after this year, but I am excited to meet new friends in my own classroom!!
</p>
<p>
  Outside of the classroom, I also am a consultant for Usborne Books & More because I love their
  books so much! I also have coached both boys in Little League for the past 3 years with many of
  the Children of Hope friends. As a family, we love to get out of the heat and enjoy some time in
  the mountains exploring and trying to burn off the never-ending boy energy we have!! We also like
  to take a summer trip to Iowa for the boys to have extended time with grandparents and cousins!
