<p>
  Hello! My name is Lynn Hockenberger and it is a true joy for me to come to work every day at Children of Hope Preschool! I have been privileged to serve as Director of this wonderful school since 2009 and have been a teacher here since the school opened in 2007. I have enjoyed being an early childhood educator since moving to the valley in 2000.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in a suburb of Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and graduated from the University of Pittsburgh with a degree in Children’s Literature with a minor in Elementary Education. I continue to take courses in the field of Early Childhood Education and have completed the Aim 4 Excellence National Director’s Credential sponsored by Arizona’s First Things First initiative. I am looking into obtaining my Master’s Degree in Early Childhood Administration. I currently hold the Faith Representative seat on the First Things First East Maricopa Regional Council and am a member of both the Evangelical Lutheran Education Association (ELEA) and the National Association for the Education of Young Children (NAEYC).
</p>

<p>
  My husband, Fritz, is a pilot with American Airlines and we are the proud parents of two adult children.  Our daughter Laura graduated from The University of Arizona and is now a Physician Assistant graduate student at The University of Charleston in West Virginia.  Our son Jake is studying to be a school counselor at The University of Arizona – Bear Down!
</p>

<p>
  I am so proud to be a part of this wonderful preschool and to work with such a great staff. I so believe in this special ministry and am very thankful to work with God’s precious children.

  The adventure continues…and this school year it begins with precious two year olds! Talkative,
  tender, tenacious, tiny, timid, trusting, and thoughtful make this teacher very thankful for
  the opportunity to work with your children.
</p>

<p>
  I was born in Goose Bay, Canada and 6 weeks later moved to Texas.  I grew up mainly in the south
  and for three years lived in Okinawa, Japan where my dad was stationed. I graduated from Stephen
  F. Austin in Nacogdoches, TX with a Bachelor of Science in Interdisciplinary Studies (Early Childhood).
  I’ve enjoyed teaching Kindergarten, 2nd grade, 4th grade, and pre-school (4’s).
</p>

<p>
  Bill and I celebrated our 20th anniversary in January.  His job has moved us to Phoenix, Fort Worth,
  Ahwatukee, Singapore, and back to Ahwatukee.  As you can see Arizona keeps pulling us back.  We have
  3 amazing children. Emily will be a sophomore attending Purdue University and Robert and Billy (twins)
  will be starting their junior year at Desert Vista.
</p>

<p>
  I enjoy volunteering for the band boosters, cheering on the Dallas Cowboys, baking, book club, and
  most of all watching my kids doing what they enjoy.  The fall is full of marching band shows (the boys)
  and the spring has many rowing regattas (Emily).
</p>

<p>
  I’m very excited and blessed to be a part of the Children of Hope staff and look forward to watching
  your children flourish in our class.

  Hi!  My name is Karin Kammerzell.  I am very excited to be teaching at Children of Hope
  for the 10th year. I feel blessed to have found such a wonderful place to work with a great
  bunch of teachers, children and parents.
</p>

<p>
  I grew up in beautiful Colorado and graduated from Colorado State University with a B.S.
  degree in Child Development. I have several years of experience working in Early Childhood
  Education.
</p>

<p>
  My family moved to Ahwatukee in January 2000. My husband Kevin and I have two wonderful
  children. Tori is a junior nursing major at NAU and our son Trevor will be a senior at
  Desert Vista. I enjoy spending time with my family, friends, reading and watching football
  (Go Broncos!). I am looking forward to my time with your children and helping them to
  experience an exciting year.

  This is my 9th year at Children of Hope and I’m very excited to be assisting Mrs. K again
  this year with both the 2 year old class and the 3 year old class.  Prior to working at
  Children of Hope I worked in the Kyrene School District for 2 years.
</p>

<p>
  My family moved from upstate New York in 2005 when my husband was transferred for work.
  We have 2 children; Rick is a senior at NAU and my daughter Julia is a sophomore at Desert Vista.

  My name is Amy Angilletta and it is an absolute joy for me to work at Children of Hope! I have
  been an assistant teacher here at Hope since 2014 and have had the privilege to work with all our
  littles, from the 2’s through the Pre-K classes. Currently, I get to spend my days with Mrs.
  Luken and our Pre-K Llamas.
</p>
<p>
  Prior to coming to Children of Hope, I worked at the elementary school level, for several years,
  as a substitute teacher, special education assistant, and most recently as a K-3 Instructional
  Assistant at Estrella. 
</p>
<p>
  I grew up in New Jersey, where I graduated from The College of New Jersey with a bachelor’s degree
  in Biology and a minor in Psychology.  My husband, Mike and I have two great, almost adult, kids.
  Our daughter Taylor will graduate from ASU in May 2020 with a degree in Music Therapy. Our son Kyle
  is a Junior at Desert Vista with a passion for all things drumming. We moved to Ahwatukee in the
  summer of 2010 for my husband’s job as a professor at ASU. Go Sun Devils! I enjoy volunteering for
  the band boosters, traveling, movies, attending live music events and watching my kids performances.
</p>
<p>
  I look forward to another wonderful year getting to know and nurture your children!

  I am excited to join Children of Hope as an Assistant Teacher in the Toddler Class.
  I truly adore this age as it is full of colorful imagination, amazing discovery and
  growing independence.
</p>
<p>
  My husband Todd and I moved to Ahwatukee from St. Louis in 2001 and we have been in love with
  the beautiful state of Arizona ever since. We have two children; Our son Brody is 14 and
  entering Desert Vista High School and our daughter Sophie is entering the 3rd grade at Monte
  Vista. Sophie is a proud alumni of Children of Hope! She started in the Toddler Class and was
  a part of the preschool all the way through Mrs. Krach and Gerrish’s Pre-K Class. Children of
  Hope has always held a special place in our family’s heart, and we have so many wonderful
  memories of when Sophie attended.
</p>
<p>
  I hold a B.S. from Southern Illinois University in Management Information Systems and was a
  software developer for Anheuser-Busch Corporation. Upon moving to Arizona I was a Group Home
  Manager which allowed me the opportunity to collaborate with Arizona Social Services and
  Foster Care Services. I have enjoyed being an active volunteer in the Kyrene school system as well.
</p>
<p>
  I am thankful for the opportunity to be a part of all the exciting experiences your child will
  enjoy this year and I look forward to helping make wonderful memories for your child and family!

<p>
  My name is Lisa Krach and the easiest way to pronounce my last name is by saying the first
  syllable in “crocodile”. I have lived in Arizona for the past sixteen years with my husband
  and twenty year old daughter.
</p>

<p>
  I taught kindergarten and first grade for eight years and then became a reading specialist
  my final year in California. I earned my Master’s Degree in early childhood reading in 1996.
  I left teaching and moved to Texas when my daughter was born. I taught preschool for two years
  in Texas then we moved here to Arizona. I taught the last nine years here at Children of Hope
  and I am looking forward to another exciting year.

<p>
  It has been my pleasure to work at Children of Hope in Mrs. Krach’s class for ten years.
  I also enjoy teaching a Science Enrichment class in the spring.
</p>

<p>
  I have been a member of Esperanza Lutheran Church for over 20 years and have enjoyed working
  with our Sunday School and Vacation Bible School programs through the years. I am originally from
  New Mexico; I grew up on the Navajo Reservation where my parents were missionaries for the
  Christian Reformed Church.
</p>

<p>
  I received a BS from the University of New Mexico and have lived in the Phoenix area with my
  husband Paul for many years. I worked at the American Cancer Society until my first daughter was
  born.  I have three grown children, Heidi (married to Miguel), Julie and Stephen. I love teaching
  little children and watching them grow and learn.

<p>
  Hello!  My name is Marianne Luken!  I am originally from Piscataway, NJ, known for being the home of Rutger’s College.  I escaped the big city to attend college in Notre Dame, Indiana, at Saint Mary’s College where I earned a BA in Elementary Education with a minor in Math and a Computer Science Endorsement.  After college, I moved to North Carolina where I taught in the public schools of Nash County for four years.  I moved to Phoenix in 2003 and when my youngest turned three I taught at God’s Garden Preschool for 6 years in three year old and Pre-K classrooms.
</p>

<p>
  I have four children:  Emma Elisabeth (Junior at Seton Catholic), Jack David (8th grade at Altadena), Clare Marie (6th grade at Altadena), and Joseph Michael (4th grade at Sierra).  We are a very busy family (to say the least).  All four kids swim competitively which helps me tour the pools of the valley.  As for me, I am an avid crafter, I love to play sports, I read daily, and I love going on adventures with my kids.  I am thrilled to join the staff and happily anticipating the new school year.  I can guarantee we will have fun, laugh, learn, and be together in the best environment I can create!

<p>
  My name is Lori Palomaa and I am a rarity: a native Arizonan, born and raised in
  Phoenix. While I have worked at Children of Hope since 2012, I have been an
  active member of Esperanza Lutheran Church for 29 years. I have been married
  to my high school sweetheart, Ray, for 40 years, and we were blessed with two
  wonderful children. Our son, Eric, and his wife, Colleen, recently moved to
  Denver, CO where our daughter Kimberly, (a high school Math teacher) lives with
  her husband, Quentin. (No grandchildren so far… just grandpuppies.)
</p>

<p>
  My greatest joy is working with children. Over the years, I have taught You &amp; Me
  Baby (pre-natal/post partum &amp; infant exercise classes), Sunday School
  (preschool-elementary), was the Sunday School coordinator for several years,
  taught Vacation Bible School, volunteered in my children’s classrooms and
  activities, coordinated (3 yrs) and taught (6 yrs) the Masterpiece Art program at
  Kyrene Monte Vista, worked extensively in the Kyrene School District as an
  Instructional Assistant at Monte Vista, a Resource Instructional Assistant at
  Colina, and as a Substitute Teacher at various schools within the Kyrene District.
  I worked for Mathnasium of Chandler at several Title I schools across the Valley,
  tutoring math as part of the No Child Left Behind Supplemental Education
  Services program. You can find me assisting in the 3’s and Pre-K classes, as
  well as teaching the Art Enrichment program for our Children of Hope
  Preschoolers, and, more recently, our Get Set For School (Handwriting &amp; Math)
  Enrichment class.
</p>

<p>
  As you can see, I love working with children! They are a gift from God, and there
  is nothing better than helping children reach their potential and to share in their
  joy and excitement. I look forward to a fabulous year watching your children
  blossom and grow. Thank you for sharing all of them with us.
