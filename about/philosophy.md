Our Philosophy
===

The philosophy behind our curriculum is that children learn best by doing. This requires
active thinking and learning by experimenting to find out how things work and to learn
first-hand about the world in which we live. Below is our organizational philosophy which
includes all of the components used to nurture learning and development that leads to
kindergarten readiness. Our methodology is based on the standards and practices
endorsed by the First Things First Quality First Program, The Creative Curriculum, the
Arizona Department of Education’s Early Learning Standards and the National
Association of the Education of Young Children’s (NAEYC) Early Learning Standards.
All lessons are designed with this information based on early childhood development
research and theory and developmentally best practices.

Learning Through God’s Love

Children of Hope Child Development Center is committed to providing a positive first
school experience within a Christian environment of understanding, acceptance and
love. We understand the importance of these early years and our staff is focused on the
miracle of each child. We are satisfied with nothing but the highest quality in our
programs.

Excellence in education is a priority at Children of Hope. As a Quality First enrolled
school, we hold ourselves to the highest industry standards and implement research
backed best practices. All faculty participate in 18 hours of continuing education each
year, with Lead Teachers possessing bachelors or masters degrees. Every teacher is
CPR/First Aid certified, background checked and licensed through the state of Arizona.
Our curriculum supports both the academic and the social/emotional growth of each
child.
