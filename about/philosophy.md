Our Philosophy
===

The philosophy behind our curriculum is that children learn best by doing. Our
methodology is based on the Creative Curriculum with a solid foundation based on early
childhood development research and theory.

Learning Through Godâ€™s Love
---

Children of Hope Child Development Center is committed to providing a positive first
school experience within a Christian environment of understanding, acceptance and love.
We understand the importance of these early years and our staff is focused on the miracle
of each child. We are satisfied with nothing but the highest quality in our programs.

The Difference
---

Excellence in education is a priority at Children of Hope. All faculty participate in
18 hours of continuing education each year, with Lead Teachers possessing bachelors
or masters degrees. Every teacher is CPR/First Aid certified, background checked and
licensed through the state of Arizona. Our curriculum, especially in the Pre-K, is in
line with the new Common Core Standards being implemented in Arizona.
