  We are thrilled to welcome <b>our very own Mrs. Jessica Mueller</b> as our new Preschool Director! ðŸŽ‰

<p>
  With a heart for early childhood education and a deep commitment to nurturing young learners, Mrs. Mueller brings over 15 years of early childhood experience and a passion for creating joyful, inclusive learning environments. She is also a long-time member of Esperanza where she previously served in leadership roles. Mrs. Mueller is a respected educator and coach in our community, nurturing our youngest learners and our high school athletes.

<p>
  We are confident that under Mrs. Mueller's guidance, our preschool will continue to be a place where curiosity is sparked, friendships are formed, the love of God is shared, and every child is celebrated.

  Please join us in giving Mrs. Mueller a warm welcome to her new role at Children of Hope! ðŸ’›
