Per Governor Ducey’s announcement to delay the start of school, we have updated our
calendar accordingly.  We are mindfully preparing for a safe, happy return to school
on __August 19th__ with all the necessary Covid protocols in place.  We can’t wait to see
our students and families and wish you all good health until we can gather again in August!
